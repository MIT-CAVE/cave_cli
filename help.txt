Utility Commands:
  help                      Prints this help text.

  interactive              Runs the app docker container and drops into `bash` for that container.
                              - Note: If you use a different Dockerfile base image, it must have 
                                      `bash` installed and globally accessable.
                              - Note: Your current app is volume mounted into the container as `/app` 
                                      so you can change files externally and get live updates.
                              - Note: The webapp is not started with this command, but can be launched
                                      with `/app/utils/run_dev_server.sh` while in interactive mode.
                              EG: `cave interactive`

                                        just the app names) with their full container names
                                        - EG: my_app_django, my_app_postgres, my_app_nginx
                                - Note: This flag is mostly only used for cave_cli development 
                                        purposes. It is not recommended for general use.
                              EG: `cave list`

  sync --url [--branch --include --exclude]
                            Merges files from the given repo (url) into the CAVE app in the
                             current directory. This always excludes the `.git` folder.
                              `--url`: str (required)
                                - What: The git `url` for a repo to which you have clone access

                                - What: A space separated string of strings (filenames) that should be
                                        included (even if in an `--exclude` statement) for a sync operation
                              `--exclude` string of space separated substrings (optional)
                                - What: A space separated string of strings (filenames) that should not be
                                        included in the sync operation (`--include` takes precedent)
                                - Note: If not excluded, a file is automatically included
                              EG: `cave sync --url git@github.com:mit-cave/cave_app_aws.git \
                                   --exclude "'.git' '.gitignore' 'README.md'"`

                              EG: `cave update --version 1.5.0`
                             
  version                   Prints the version of your installed CAVE CLI.

Global Flags:
  `-l` | `-legacy`:         Runs the legacy version of the cli (not docker based). 
                              - Note: Some commands differ as this is direct access to the legacy CLI
                                - See `cave help -legacy`
                              - EG: `cave run -l`

  `--ll` | `--loglevel`:    Specify a log level to use for any command from the list: 
                              - ['DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARN', 'ERROR', 'SILENT']
                              - EG: `cave version --loglevel ERROR`
                                - Note: Returns nothing since version is INFO level by default

  `-v` | `-verbose` :       Enable verbose logging output (shorthand for `--loglevel DEBUG`)
                              - Note: This overules `--loglevel` if both are specified
                              - EG: `cave run -v`

  `-y`:                     Automatically answer (bypass) any confirmation prompts with `y`.
                              - Note: This is useful for scripting
                              - EG: `cave reset-db -y`
